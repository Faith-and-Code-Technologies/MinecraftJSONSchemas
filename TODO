IN PROGRESS:
- data/block_entity_data.json | https://minecraft.wiki/w/Chunk_format#Block_entity_format
- world/entity/* | https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity_format#Mobs

OTHER:
- Normalize `title` and `description` styles
- Look through finished schemas to add `required` and `additionalProperties` tags
- Use `allOf` when using a `$ref` and metadata tags
- Some booleans I have added should actually be bytes. (Which means we should do an integer with a 1 as max and 0 as min.)

FEAT:
- Take all `title` and `descriptions` into a lang file, and create src/compiler.py to compile the lang into the schemas
